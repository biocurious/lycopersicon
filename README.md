# Lycopersicon Grafting Project.

Members:  Shashank, Rikke, Jarl

The purpose of this project is to graft Money Maker scions unto a
Galapagos root stalk.

For the purpose, 4 Galapagos cuttings were taken from the growth
chamber, palced in 4 Falcon tubes and returned to the groth chamber.

The light cycle of the growth chamber was 16 Hours on 8 hours off.

Notes:

2015-sep-02: Made 4 cuttings of Lycopersicon (Galapagos). Planted in
20 ml tap water in 50 ml Falcon tubes. Water level kept around 20 ml
throughout the experiment.

2015-sep-06: Shashank added IAA 1 microgram per milliliter ie. 1ppm to
2 cuttings.

2015-sep-16: Rikke replanted the cuttings into 4 inch pots filled with
soil.  Rikke made 4 cuttings of the Money Maker and planted them into
the Falcon tubes in 20 ml tap water.  The purpose for this is to
create viable scions for next week.
